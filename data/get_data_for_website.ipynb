    "2) is movie significant ? -> p-value\n",
    "3) same release year for several movies -> keep the one that is the most rated (number of ratings)\n",
    "4) keep categories of 5 : top 5, most 5 popular movies which are not significant, bottom 5\n",
    "5) remove all movies that have less than 100 ratings (to be determined maybe we discard too many movies or too litte...)\n",
    "6) remove all characters that have an order below the median (or mean) of the number of character in the movie.\n",
    "7) Careful : the number of movies with significant impact on baby names may drop a lot due to the point 5 and 6\n",
    "8) the point 5 and 6 must be done also for the global study and not only for the website interactive heading (TO BE DISCUSSED!!)"
